Version 0.8 (2008-07-09)
-----------
- Official Thunderbird 3 support (tested on current nightly, 3.0a2pre+)

Version 0.7 (2008-04-06)
-----------
(Never officially released - rolled in to 0.8)
- Fixed a bug when sorted ascending in threaded view, new messages wouldn't sink to
  the bottom of your list (the "top" in an ascending sort)

Version 0.6 (2007-07-11)
-----------
- Updated the minimum version so AMO will accept it

Version 0.5 (2007-05-05)
-----------
- Threadbubble now requires Thunderbird 2.0.0.0 or above, because I rewrote it to use
  the msgnotificationservice class.  I was running into (I think) a bug in
  thunderbird:

  If you have a new message in an existing thread, and you delete the top
  level element in that thread, the OnItemAdded event is called as if the new message
  just arrived.  If you delete any other message in the thread other than the root
  message, OnItemAdded is not fired, and if there is not a new message in the thread,
  it's not fired.  This feels like a bug to me.

  The problem I was having was, if you delete the top level message and there is only
  2 total messages in the thread, the second would disappear from the folder until
  the view was refreshed (note: the mail did not get deleted, it just didn't show up
  in the view).  

  Since I think we're leaning towards using the nsIMsgFolderNotificationService
  interface, I didn't file a bug for this issue.


Version 0.4 (2007-04-20)
-----------
- Added checks to make sure mail coming in is in the current account and folder
  before updating the display

Version 0.3 (2007-04-01)
-----------
- Added a setTimeout() around the whole thing, since gDBView wasn't ready sometimes
- Added a check to make sure gDBView is around, and if it's not, don't throw an
  uncaught exception

Version 0.2
-----------
- Increased the maxVersion to 3.0a1 since it looks like that's what all the other
  kids are doing.
- Fixed the homepage URL
